## Project philosophy

At the moment, SolderMonkey is a company that I maintain in my spare time. I currently sell products that I have developed through hacking on my own time in order to meet my needs. I decided to start SolderMonkey on the idea that other makers will hopefully find my solutions useful for their needs aswell. SolderMonkey is focused on the enthusiast community that sprung out of a venture previously called GLK Robotics. We make both electronic and mechanical products, with our first product being a 680 pin four column proto-board that the community took great interest in.

## Roadmap

Right now, SolderMonkey makes low volume products for the hobbyist hacker, with products sold on Tindie. At the moment, I am focused on another venture in the maker community and any growth of SolderMonkey beyond what it is currently will most likely take place after that other venture has settled down in to a self-sustaining company. That will be announced soon.
